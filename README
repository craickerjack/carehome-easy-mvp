CareHome Easy MVP
==================

## How to Start the Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This will start a local server at port 5000.

## How to Open the Site

Open your web browser and go to:

   http://localhost:5000

You will see the CareHome Easy dashboard and can navigate to all modules from there.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/craickerjack/carehome-easy-mvp)
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages** (or "Pages" under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: Select `main` and `/ (root)` for the folder
5. Click **Save**
6. After a minute or two, your site will be live at:
   - https://craickerjack.github.io/carehome-easy-mvp/

**Note:** The GitHub Pages hosting is for static content only. To use the care plan features that require the database, you'll need to deploy the Flask backend to a proper hosting service.

**Tip:**
- Make sure your internal links are relative (e.g., `href="residents.html"`)
- If you update your site, just push changes to GitHub and it will redeploy automatically
